# MEDICAL_INSURANCE_AMOUNT_PREDICTION

This project uses machine learning to predict health insurance costs based on factors like age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. By employing algorithms such as Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Regressor, the model estimates insurance charges with high accuracy.
The Gradient Boosting Regressor is selected as the best model for its superior performance in minimizing prediction error. This tool aids insurance companies and individuals in estimating healthcare expenses and making informed financial decisions.
